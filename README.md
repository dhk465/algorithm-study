# Self-study with Challenging Algorithm Problems
Challenging myself with 1 commit a day

- Must be a challenge and NOT language-oriented
- Mimimum one challenge a day (do not slack off!)
- Maximum two challenges a day (do not overdo it and lose interest!)
- Use many sources such as HackerRank, LeetCode and etc.
- Do NOT search for a solution under any circumstances! (including Stackoverflow)
- Use language-specific documentations for help.
